### Hi
I like to code.
## Lightning Video Chat
I tried to make my own video chat app, and it worked just fine!
But, I need style Ideas.
> Note: to use this, you need to be on the same browser as the person you are chatting with.
> so if you're using Firefox 80, and whoever you are chatting with has Firefox 79 or Chrome 80, it won't work. This may be a bug and I am doing my best to fix it.

@agaudana is someone who I like to code with.

## More repositories
I am always finding new languages and stuff to code.
I will probably post on GitHub here.
